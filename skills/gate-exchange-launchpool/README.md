## MCP Tools Used

- `cex_launch_list_launch_pool_projects`: Browse available LaunchPool projects
- `cex_launch_create_launch_pool_order`: Create staking order
- `cex_launch_redeem_launch_pool`: Redeem staked assets
- `cex_launch_list_launch_pool_pledge_records`: Query pledge history
- `cex_launch_list_launch_pool_reward_records`: Query reward history

## Error Handling

The skill gracefully handles various error scenarios:
- Empty results: Suggests alternative queries or actions
- Compliance restrictions: Displays friendly regional restriction message
- Insufficient balance: Guides user to check balance or reduce amount
- API failures: Provides retry guidance
- Missing parameters: Asks clarifying questions

## Security Considerations

- **Confirmation required**: Stake and redeem operations require explicit user confirmation
- **Authentication required**: All operations except project browsing need user authentication
- **Compliance handling**: Regional restrictions are respected and communicated clearly
- **No fabrication**: Only displays data from actual API responses
